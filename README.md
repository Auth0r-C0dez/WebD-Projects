# Web Development Projects Repository

Welcome to the **WebD Projects** repository by [Auth0r-C0dez](https://github.com/Auth0r-C0dez)! ðŸš€ This repository contains a collection of web development projects ranging from basic to advanced. Each project showcases different aspects of front-end and back-end development.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Projects are categorized into three levels:

1. **Beginner** - Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript projects.
2. **Intermediate** - Projects using frameworks like React, Vue, and simple back-end setups.
3. **Advanced** - Full-stack applications with databases, authentication, and complex logic.

Each project is organized in its own directory with a `README.md` containing project details, setup instructions, and a demo link if available.
